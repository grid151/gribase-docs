## Step 2: Activate the Plugin

## Step 3: Configure the Plugin
1. After activation, navigate to **GridBase API** under **Settings** in the WordPress Admin sidebar.
2. On the settings page, you will see a field for **GridBase API Key**.

## Step 5: Using Shortcodes 
You can use the GridBase plugin features on any page or post by inserting shortcodes. For example:
- To display the **Seller Net Sheet**, use the following shortcode: `[gridbase_seller_netsheet]`
- To display the **Buyer Cost Estimate**, use the following shortcode: `[gridbase_buyer_cost_estimate]`
  
Simply paste these shortcodes into the content editor of the page or post where you'd like the features to appear. The plugin will handle the rest.

## Troubleshooting
If you encounter any issues during the installation or configuration process, here are some common solutions:
- **Plugin not uploading**: Ensure you're using the correct ZIP file format and that your WordPress installation allows file uploads.
- **API Key issues**: Double-check that the API key you entered is correct and has the necessary permissions. 
- **Shortcode not working**: Make sure you have saved the changes in the plugin settings and that you are using the correct shortcode syntax.
